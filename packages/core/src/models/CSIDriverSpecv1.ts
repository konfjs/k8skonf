As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn\'t support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.

Kubernetes will call NodeStage / NodePublish with \"-o context=xyz\" mount option when mounting a ReadWriteOncePod volume used in Pod that has explicitly set SELinux context. In the future, it may be expanded to other volume AccessModes. In any case, Kubernetes will ensure that the volume is mounted only with a single SELinux context.

A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume.
